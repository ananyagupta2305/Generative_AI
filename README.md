# **Multi-File RAG & LLM Chat System with Streamlit**

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with support for multi-file interaction and a simple LLM (Large Language Model) chat interface<br>
using Streamlit for the frontend. The system allows users to upload various types of files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MP3, MP4) for retrieval-augmented responses and enables a<br>
simple conversational interface using an LLM (LLaMA 8B via the Groq API) for natural language queries.<br>

The application is designed with two core components:<br>
1. RAG (Multi-file Interaction): Retrieve relevant content from multiple uploaded files to provide context-based responses.<br>
2. LLM Chat: Enable users to have a direct conversation with an LLM (LLaMA 8B) for simple queries and interactions.<br>
